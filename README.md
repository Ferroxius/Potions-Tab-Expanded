# Potions-Tab-Expanded - Next Generation Edition
### Introduction
In the alchemical items tab of the inventory the Oils, Potions and Bombs are arranged in equal spaces. On paper this looks clean and works nicely, however scaled up to when you have multiple decoctions and potions the Potions segment starts to become a bit overloaded while the Oils and Bombs segments never suffer from this

As such I have made a small adjustment to the grid layout of these segments so that the Potions segment has more space and the Oils and Bombs segments have less space

This mod is made specifically for the Complete Edition/Next Gen Update and NOT for the Classic Edition/Old Gen

### Installation
Download and place the main file in your mods folder

### Uninstallation
Take the main file out of your mods folder

### Compatability
This mod makes changes to panel_inventory.redswf and as such it is incompatible with any mod that also changes this file. If other mods need patches then I will make them eventually

### Credits
MerseyRockoff for the mod concept and telling me where to edit the values in the gfx files
